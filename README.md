### Howdy, I'm Holden Jahn 👋🏼

I am a student at Texas A&M University studying Technology Management. I am looking for opportunities to intern for companies that can give me an edge in the field. I have a passion for learning new skills and I want to expand my knowledge in Data Analysis. I am currently working on building my tech portfolio with numerous projects and research.
